# PleiadesDAO — Public Overview

PleiadesDAO is a governance and coordination framework designed for
long-horizon, multi-agent, and multi-generational systems.

This document provides a **public, high-level overview**.
Detailed governance logic, internal mechanisms, and core constraints
are intentionally documented elsewhere and are not fully public by design.

## What PleiadesDAO Is

PleiadesDAO is not a single application, protocol, or product.

It is best understood as a **structural operating system** that enables:

- Long-term coordination (10–100 year horizons)
- Human and AI agent collaboration
- Rule-based governance with controlled evolution
- Separation of decision authority, execution, and audit

Rather than solving one narrow problem, PleiadesDAO provides a **container**
in which multiple initiatives can coexist while sharing a common governance logic.

## Why PleiadesDAO Exists

Modern systems face three recurring failures when scaled over time:

1. **Governance decay** — rules drift, authority concentrates, accountability weakens
2. **Execution mismatch** — strategic intent diverges from day-to-day operation
3. **Time horizon collapse** — short-term incentives override long-term stability

PleiadesDAO is designed to address these failures by treating governance
as a **first-class system**, not an afterthought.

## Current Areas of Exploration

At its current stage, PleiadesDAO is actively exploring two application domains.
These are **implementations of the framework**, not the framework itself.

### 1) Smart Family Trusts

Applying programmable governance, cryptographic controls, and AI-assisted execution
to multi-generational trust and asset structures.

Focus areas include:

- Rule-based inheritance and succession
- Controlled automation with human oversight
- Privacy-preserving compliance across jurisdictions

### 2) Long-Horizon Infrastructure & Civilization-Oriented Investment

Designing governance and decision frameworks for long-duration infrastructure,
emerging technologies, and future-oriented systems.

This includes:

- Agent-assisted evaluation and execution
- Explicit risk and audit separation
- Governance structures that remain coherent across decades

---

## Governance Philosophy (Public View)

PleiadesDAO follows several high-level principles:

- **Layered authority** — no single actor controls strategy, execution, and audit
- **Human finality** — humans retain ultimate decision authority
- **Agent specialization** — AI agents operate within explicit scopes
- **Transparency with limits** — visibility without unnecessary exposure
- **Evolution without rupture** — systems can upgrade without losing continuity

Operational specifics are intentionally abstracted at the public level.

---

## Documentation Access Model

PleiadesDAO documentation is intentionally tiered:

- `/docs/public` — public, shareable materials
- `/docs/investor` — limited access, for qualified discussions
- `/docs/internal` — operational documents
- `/docs/core` — steward-level canonical constraints

This structure exists to preserve clarity, security, and long-term coherence.

## Status

PleiadesDAO is in an early architectural phase.
Concepts, roles, and implementations are expected to evolve.

This repository serves as the **canonical public reference**.
If public materials conflict with internal documentation,
the internal documentation prevails by design.
